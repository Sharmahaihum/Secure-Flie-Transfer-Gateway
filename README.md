# File_Transfer_Gateway


This project implements a secure file transfer system between two users, ensuring confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the transferred data. The system utilizes encryption and hashing techniques to protect the data and verify its integrity upon receipt.






## Features
Secure Channel: Establishes a secure connection between two users for file transfer.
Confidentiality: Encrypts the file content to prevent unauthorized access during transmission.
Authenticity: Ensures that the data is sent and received by the intended users.
Integrity: Uses hashing to verify that the received message is identical to the sent message, detecting any tampering or corruption during transmission.
## Libraries used

Hashlib,
Gradio,
Socket programming
